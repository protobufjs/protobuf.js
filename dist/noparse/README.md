This folder contains prebuilt browser versions of [protobuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js) without the .proto parser. When sending pull requests, it is not required to update these.

**NOTE:** This slightly smaller version of the full library can be used as a drop-in replacment where .proto parsing is not required, i.e. when only working with JSON files generated by pbjs as recommended for production.

Prebuilt files are in source control to enable pain-free frontend respectively CDN usage:
